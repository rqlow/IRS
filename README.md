# Section 2: Executive Summary / Abstract
Food wastage has been an increasingly serious and long persisting global problem. While entities and corporations have put in place measures to tackle this issue from a supply chain perspective, consumers can also do their part in reducing their domestic food wastage. This project aims to implement a system with smart features to support consumers in making smarter decisions when managing their household perishables inventory.

The project has targeted the problem from three key focus areas: (1) fast and convenient inventory recording, (2) timely consumption reminders, and (3) smart purchase recommendations to encourage mindful purchasing. In order to achieve these objectives, the project maintains a knowledge base which contains the historical data from the user, and a knowledge base of food grocery items. These knowledge bases were used by the different reasoning models, and the frontend interface system to make logical deductions and recommendations to the user.

The project has implemented a smart OCR system which takes in receipt image input to generate purchase records for convenient inventory logging. We have also implemented a purchase recommendation system based on projected inventory levels and past consumption data. Lastly, there is also a consumption reminder system to remind consumers of food expiry dates. All the above features are integrated and presented to the user through an intuitive and interactive web application. With the above, the implemented system functionalities were able to achieve the targeted project objectives.
