<h5>All of our team members have one common problem... we throw away food, not because the food sucks but because it has long expired.</h5>
<br>
<h5>Most of the time, none of us knew about our expiring food products until it came alive and started forming colonies in our refrigerators.</h5>
<br>
<p>
Ok, jokes aside, food wastage is a very common problem in most households. Our founders, like how most great ideas come about, got fed up of throwing away food and money and decided to come together and create an application that allows users to track and manage their grocery and food products in a smarter way.
</p>
<p>
And so, the MustEatNow! smart application was born. Use our app to better manage your food!
